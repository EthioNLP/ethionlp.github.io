  # abstract: "Language models (LMs) have become more popular in recent years due to their outstanding performance on various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, low-resource languages are still left behind by the current state-of-the-art developments in NLP fields due to insufficient resources to train LMs. In this paper, we introduce LMs for 17 Ethiopian languages, 13 of which had not previously been included in any LM development initiatives. We evaluate the performance of the LMs in four selected languages for different downstream NLP tasks. We conducted an error analysis for the downstream task to identify areas where the model falls short and provide actionable insights for future research."
