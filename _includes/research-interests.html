              <p class="text-muted">Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the core component of AI. There are efforts throughout the world to conduct NLP for Ethiopian languages but without a formal communication among researchers. At COLING 2018, Santa Fe, USA, three researchers from Addis Ababa University (Binyam), University of Hamburg (Seid), and University of Trento (Surafel) took an initiative to create a formal NLP society for Ethiopian language NLP research. </p>
              <p class="text-muted">✔   Ethiopia is a country with multinational and multilingual that support more that 83 different languages</p>
              <p class="text-muted">✔   All the languages are underrepresented in NLP application. Now, EthioNLP is a well-organized and research oriented community</p>

                    <!-- <p class="text-muted">A corpus is a fundamental requirement for NLP tasks as it comprises a collection of texts, images, audio, or video used for training and analysis. These collections can consist of content from a single language or multiple languages, depending on the task at hand. Corpora serve as the primary source of data for NLP algorithms, enabling systems to learn language patterns and semantics. The selection and curation of diverse and high-quality corpora are crucial for developing accurate and robust NLP models, allowing researchers to gain insights and advancements in language processing.</p> -->
