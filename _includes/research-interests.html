                <p class="text-muted">Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the core component of AI. There are efforts throughout the world to conduct NLP for Ethiopian languages but without a formal communication among researchers. At COLING 2018, Santa Fe, USA, three researchers from Addis Ababa University (Binyam), University of Hamburg (Seid), and University of Trento (Surafel) took an initiative to create a formal NLP society for Ethiopian language NLP research. </p>
                <p class="text-muted">✔ Ethiopia is a country with multinational and multilingual that support more that 83 different languages</p>
                <p class="text-muted">✔ All the languages are underrepresented in NLP application. Now, EthioNLP is a well-organized and research oriented community</p>
