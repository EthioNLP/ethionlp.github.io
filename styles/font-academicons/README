academicons -- high quality icons of online academic profiles

The "academicons" package provides access in (La)TeX to 138 high quality icons
of online academic profiles included in the free "Academicons" font. This
package requires either the Xe(La)TeX or Lua(La)TeX engine to load the
"Academicons" font from the system, which requires installing the bundled
"academicons.ttf" font file. As new releases come out, it is recommended to
install the bundled font version as there may be differences between the package
and previous font versions or newest font versions not yet contemplated in the
package.

The "Academicons" font was designed by James Walsh and released (see
http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) under the open SIL Open Font License
(available at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). This package is a redistribution of
the free "Academicons" font with specific bindings for (La)TeX. It is inspired
and based on the "fontawesome" package (available at
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome).

The academicons package provides the generic "\aiicon" command to access icons,
which takes as mandatory argument the name of the desired icon. It also
provides individual direct commands for each specific icon. The full list of
icons and their respective names and direct commands can be found in the
manual. For example, "\aiicon{googlescholar}" yields the same result as
"\aiGoogleScholar".
